# 1. What is a Group in Linux?
A group in Linux is a collection of users.
It’s used to assign permissions (read/write/execute) to multiple users at once — instead of giving permissions individually.

For example:
  - You have users: ravendra, sunny, abhinav
  - You create a group: developers
  - Add all 3 users to it
  - Give /var/www access to group developers

Now all users in that group automatically get access.
