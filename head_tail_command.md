# What is head and tail command in linux ?
`tail` is a Linux command used to view the end (last lines) of a file.
By default, it prints the last 10 lines.

`head` is a Linux/Unix command used to view the beginning (top lines) of a file.
By default, it prints the first 10 lines of the file.
It‚Äôs commonly used to preview files, check headers, or quickly examine large files without opening the whole thing.
