**ðŸ‘‰ Displays detailed information about files and directories**
```
ls -l
```
**ðŸ‘‰ List all files, including hidden ones**
```
ls -a
```
**ðŸ‘‰ Display detailed information in human-readable format**
```
ls -lh
```
**ðŸ‘‰ Sort files by modification time in reverse order**
```
ls -ltr
```
**ðŸ‘‰ List files recursively, including subdirectories**
```
ls -R
```
**ðŸ‘‰ Show inode numbers of files**
```

```
**ðŸ‘‰ List directories without showing their contents**
```

```

# ========================ðŸ“Œ ls Command (Advanced Options)=============================#

**ðŸ‘‰ 1. Sort by time**
```bash
ls -lt       # newest files first
ls -ltr      # oldest files first
ls -ltu      # sort by last access time
ls -ltc      # sort by last status change time
```
