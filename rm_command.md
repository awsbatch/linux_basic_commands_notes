## ðŸ‘‰  Important Notes

**Be Careful:** 
> The rm command does not move files to a trash bin; they are permanently deleted.
Use -i for Safety: Adding the -i option ensures you confirm each deletion, reducing accidental data loss.
Avoid rm -rf /: This command can delete the entire filesystem and should never be used unless you are absolutely sure of its consequences.
