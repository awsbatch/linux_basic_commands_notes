The touch command in Linux is primarily used to modify the timestamps of a file. However, it is commonly used to create empty files. The command can change the access, modification, and change times of files and directories.

## Syntax
```
touch <options> <file or directory name>
```

```
touch filename
```

```
touch -a filename
```

touch -m filename
```
